# Task 13 – PCA Dimensionality Reduction

## Objective
To understand dimensionality reduction using PCA and analyze variance-accuracy tradeoff.

## Dataset
Sklearn Digits Dataset

## Steps Performed
- Loaded and scaled dataset
- Applied PCA with multiple components
- Visualized explained variance
- Trained Logistic Regression on reduced data
- Compared accuracy with original dataset
- Visualized 2D PCA projection

## Results
- PCA reduced features with minimal accuracy loss
- Best trade-off observed at 30–50 components

## Conclusion
PCA helps reduce dimensionality while retaining important information.
